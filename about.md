Hey there!

I'm Nikhil and this is my blog.

I speak code in this blog.
So, when I say 'port', I'm not refering to a place where ships dock. Similarly, a thread here is no longer a thin strand of cotton and executing a program is not at all the same thing as killing it.

I also write two other blogsâ€”[10minread](https://10minread.blogspot.in) and [Byte Soup](https://bytesoup.blogspot.in).

You can reach me from the links below.
